# pokebox
Recreation of the Pokemon box system from Pokemon Platinum (with a few modifications, additions, and omissions) in C++ using SFML

If you want to run this, you'll need SFML installed on your system. Then again, you'd be missing all the images and other assets because github won't let me upload anything remotely large in size or large in number. Sorry, my hands are tied :(
